# Android Application Development - exercises
This is an Android Application Development course exercises repository "template".

## How to work
Each student downloads this exercise repository from the Android Application 
Development workspace at JAMK GitLab. After that, each student need to import this 
exercise repository back to JAMK GitLab (to create own repository) with his/her own account and complete each exercise 
inside this repository.

When you are creating a new repository using this template, 
REMEMBER USE <b>android-exercises</b> as a repository name, otherwise evaluation tool can't find your repository!

Student need to add teacher to repository member for an evaluation purposes. Teacher need at least a Reporter role.

Student need to use this repository Issues Boards and drag an exercise issue from 
<b>Backlog</b> to <b>Doing</b> section when student start's working with an exercise. 
Student need to remember move an issue to <b>In Review</b> section in Issues Boards when student has 
finished one of the exercise and pushed an exercise work back into his/her exercise repository at JAMK GitLab. 
This way teacher knows that student has finished an exercise/issue and teacher can start an exercise evaluation. 
<b>Teacher</b> will move an issue to the <b>Closed</b> section in a Issues Boards when exercise is approved. 
Teacher is monitoring your learning process all the time!

Student need first to clone this repository to his/her local machine to start working with this repository. 
Use this repository and complete each exercise as an own project inside this repository.
Each exercise is described as an individual issue. 
Read carefully all the information and rules below before you start coding.

Note! Don't delete or create a new issues to this repository!

## Repository structure

### Project name
Each project should be named with the givin naming rule in each exercise instructions. 
Read carefully each exercise instruction from issues.

### Project work comments
Student needs to <b>add a comment</b> to issues section when student moves issue/exercise to <b>In Review</b> in Issues Board. 

Each comment should include information about your exercise work. Describe how the exercise is done and how 
it works and/or is there still a some errors. Include needed links to other related materials in a web which describes how your have done your exercise. 
You can record a video and upload it to YouTube or you can add videos or screenshots folder in your repository (in your exercise project folder). 
For video recording, you can use e.g. <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic</a>. 
Exercise will not accepted if there is not a comment in exercise/issues description board and/or
your project folder doesn't contain files with needed for an evaluation.

### Screenshots and videos
Each project should include Screenshots folder or link to recorded video (for example to YouTube). 
These screenshots and videos demonstrates your application functionality. Video files can
be in internet, for example YouTube. Remember then include links to your comments in issues.

Don't include video files to your repository - those take a too much space!

### Repository structure example
Below is an example repository structure. Example contains two projects: FirstApplication and BuildUIWithLayoutEditor.
Both project has screenshots. All other files are related to created Android Studio project.

File/Folder | Description           
-------------|-------------
README.md | This file
FirstApplication | FirstApplication project folder
FirstApplication/Screenshots/image01.png | Screenshot of the project
FirstApplication/Screenshots/image02.png | Another screenshot
FirstApplication/app/ | Android project related files
FirstApplication/gradle | ... 
... | ...
BuildUIWithLayoutEditor | BuildUIWithLayoutEditor project folder
BuildUIWithLayoutEditor/Screenshots/image01.png | Screenshot of the project

## Evaluation 
Import exercise repository to GitLab and clone it to your computer, create Android projects inside this repo, code, add, commit, push/sync repo. 
When you are starting an another exercise, you only need to create a new project inside this repository in your computer, start coding, add files, 
commit and push it GitLab.

Remember use Issues Boards and drag/drop exercise issue to <b>In Review</b> section when you have completed one of your exercise project. 
This way teacher knows what exercises you have completed and teacher can start evaluation of your exercise work. Remember do this every time when 
you are finished one of the exercises! This way teacher can start evaluation process immediately meanwhile you are working with other exercises.

All the evaluation criterias can be found in Android Application Development web site.

## Exercises 
All the exercises can be found inside this repository [Issues Boards](/../boards).

Remember create a new project for each exercise/issues inside this repository. Read carefully all the exercise instructions before coding. 
Remember move exercise issue to <b>In Review</b> section in Issues Board, when you have completed your exercise project work.
